I think President Biden would be wise to announce policy objectives that will make a real difference for people in this country. He could start with a call to provide Medicare for all. He could follow that up with a proposal to end inherited wealth, and free higher education. He could finish with student loan debt relief. I know we will not get a single piece of legislation through that accomplishes any of those things.

He is dumb, so he sees things as black or white; there are no subtleties, no complicating factors; it\'s all a game of opposites, it\'s black or it\'s white.
