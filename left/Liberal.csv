Then, agencies were told they could place employees on administrative leave, a paid suspension used widely for short-term absences but also when a manager proposes removing an employee.\n“They seem like they decided to go with a harder approach,” said Jeff Friday, general counsel for the National Federation of Federal Employees, which has about 100,000 members at the Defense Department, U.S. Forest Service and other agencies. “You’re still going to have to work until you’re let go,” Friday said. “Paid leave is certainly a disincentive to getting vaccinated.” The rules on how to enforce the mandate were among several new details of what will be a complex, potentially messy process that will likely stretch deep into winter if not longer, given the government’s sprawling size and presence in every state. The details will leave multiple groups of people following different rules in the same workplace.\nIn most agencies, for example, civil servants work side-by-side with employees who work for federal contractors. But under the policy announced by the president last week, contractors who are not vaccinated must provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within three days before entering a federal facility — or enroll in a regular testing program. Contractors, federal workers and visitors who show they are vaccinated are required to wear masks indoors in federal buildings located in areas of high or substantial viral transmission, but not in areas where transmission is lower. Visitors must attest to their status before entering a federal building — although not if they are coming to receive benefits. Unvaccinated visitors or those who decline to provide their status also must provide proof of a negative test taken three days or sooner before coming into the building.\nMost of the 2.1 million federal employees must receive their last dose of their vaccine no later than Nov. 8 to meet a Nov. 22 deadline to be fully vaccinated. The timing between the first and second shots will depend on which vaccine they take. Teleworking employees must get shots, too, and proof of vaccination can be transmitted electronically, according to the new rules. Those who are not fully vaccinated or decline to tell their bosses their status must wear masks in the office, physically distance from colleagues and comply with restrictions for work travel. New hires who are scheduled to start work after Nov. 22 must be fully vaccinated, except in “limited circumstances” where the government must make a reasonable accommodation to exempt them, the guidance says. Exceptions can be made for “urgent, mission-critical” hires, but those employees must be vaccinated within 60 days.\nThe task force said it is preparing additional guidance on how agencies should consider requests for religious and medical exemptions to the vaccine, a provision of the mandate that has stirred concern the offices will establish wildly varying standards. To many set to be involved in the process, enforcement of the mandate remains the most worrisome provision. Union officials and attorneys who represent federal employees say they are concerned that managers could move to dismiss workers with exemplary records if they don’t want a vaccine. They also said firing large swaths of employees would be unrealistic in parts of the country with low overall vaccination rates.\n“Are some agencies just going to look the other way?” asked Debra D’Agostino, a founding partner of the Federal Practice Group in Washington. “In some places they would be losing a huge chunk of the workforce if they moved to fire people. It can’t be that black and white.” Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough acknowledged the possibility this week as he contemplated the repercussions for some 45,000 employees of the Veterans Health Administration — the agency’s largest department — who, operating under the separate mandate announced this summer, have not completed paperwork attesting that they have gotten shots or that they intend to. McDonough said his staff is working with union officials and reaching out to these employees with a “public awareness campaign.” The employees have until Oct. 8 to either get fully vaccinated or request a medical or religious accommodation.\nThose who fail to comply will be subject to the “progressive discipline” process, he said. But he added that “the last thing we want to do is have to fire trained personnel.” Union officials said they do not believe any discipline for the broader workforce would begin before the November deadline. An agency should first use a carrot approach, explaining the benefits of the vaccine and ways to get a shot, the guidance says. If someone still refuses to comply, managers should follow the disciplinary process laid out in their collective bargaining agreements with employees. These often start with warnings, a letter of reprimand or suspensions before dismissal.\nUnder federal personnel law, an agency generally must first propose a disciplinary action, cannot take effect before 30 days have passed, during which the employee has the opportunity to respond. The agency must consider the response before taking a final action. There is no deadline for the agency to make a final decision after receiving that response and in many cases the process takes much longer than 30 days. Guidance for the first coronavirus plan, issued in late July, explicitly called for administrative leave — paid by the government — for some who declined to be tested. Administrative leave has been part of the disciplinary process for federal employees, but it has been abused by managers who used it to sideline troublesome workers while misconduct or poor performance reports were adjudicated, and managers were often slow to move the disciplinary process forward.\nThe Trump administration sought to speed up the dismissal process as part of a controversial series of executive orders that tried to weaken the unions that represent more than half the federal workforce. But Biden reversed the policies within days of taking office. The new guidance anticipates that before moving to fire an employee, an agency generally would use progressive discipline, said Michael Kator, of Kator, Parks, Weiser & Harris, a D.C. law firm specializing in federal employment law. “For example, an agency could say ‘If you don’t do this, we’re going to suspend you. After suspension, if you haven’t gotten vaccinated, you’re going to be disciplined again,’\u2009” he said in a phone interview. “It can go through multiple iterations until they finally get to the point where they say ‘Ok, we get it, you don’t want to comply, you’re fired.’\u2009” He said one possible basis for firing would be a charge of insubordination. “They will get a directive from their agency head or their supervisor to do this and if they don’t do it, just like any other direction from the supervisor, if it’s lawful they’re pretty much obligated to comply,” he said.', ""I'm tired of these whiners, just fire them, there's plenty of people who would love the work!!"", 'I imagine the shame will help push people but lots of these folks seemingly have no shame.']"

337,Debunking three videos from the right.,4,text,"Videos in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4Y1m28hVtk&t=503s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgK4Io8pFPs&t=144s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM I started watching the first vid (from like 8min in because the link automatically goes there, lmk if that was a mistake) and it's clear that they are conflating their criticisms of the new pride flag from a visual standpoint (thinking it looks ugly or a unnecessarily complex is ofc a valid opinion) with the legitimacy of the pride movement itself They think that the pride flag isn't needed, and therefore anyone who uses it is self centered and arrogant. The premise that they state directly is that lgbt people are doing just as well as non lgbt people and don't have any major discrimination Anyone who looks at data would know that lgbt people still face increased rates of discrimination, violence, and social stigma and rejection. Literally the fact that most lgbt people still have to worry about how to ""come out"" to their family and friends, fearing anything from rejection to outright violence, is enough to justify people using whatever pride flag they like They're trying to convince their audience that homophobia doesn't exist anymore and thus pride is useless or bad. But they don't bring up any data or reasoning behind their personal opinions of it being fine in the UK Then they talk about the rapper, while doing so they imply that children who are too young to do xyz, can just cut off their genitals and change their gender In reality, rarely does any trans child under 18 go through any kind of surgery. And if they do, it would only be after a medical doctor extensively observes the child and their records and finds it medically necessary for their mental health And that only happens if the doctor is sure the child understands their decision completely. But that happens very rarely But people like Sargon Akkad or whatever his name is want you to think that a 7 year old can just walk into a doctors office and demand a same day sex realignment surgery In reality, it's more like a 16 year old talking to multiple doctors for years and everyone coming to the conclusion that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks The rest of that video is honestly just bad comedy ""haha trans people can't have kids but they'll try to get half the world"" or something like that. Last thing about that one: straight pride isn't necessary neither is a straight rights campaign because no one is going after the rights of straight people. Is there any political group trying to reduce the rights of straight people? No, but there are many who try to make discrimination against gay people legal. They outright reject that people rn are campaigning for lgbt rights because they think, for whatever reason, that lgbt rights aren't being threatened and lgbt people don't feel uncomfortable. Both are wrong ofc 2nd video Okay they're hyperfocusing on one argument they disagree with so far So people were saying that the shooter was racist because he chose to target a place where mainly Asian people were. Their argument is that since the shooter didn't say he had racist motivations that it's crazy to believe the shooting had anything to do with race. If someone shoots an Asian restaurant and then claims ""I just wanted to shoot a restaurant"" you couldn't blame people for thinking that there are more motivations given the location he chose. Or if someone shoots a black church only to claim ""I just wanted to shoot a church"" then you wouldn't blame people for assuming he still had other motivations. Even if you disagree with people who say that we have to assume race was a motivation given the context of everything but the shooter's words, you can't just blame people for disagreeing with you or think they're crazy. Wait the murderer first targeted an Asian spar and then drove 27 miles to shoot another Asian spar? C'mon, they can't possibly think it's crazy for people to think he is racially motivated They really think that unless the shooter explicitly says it's about race then it's unjustified to say race was part of it? Subconscious bias exists for one, oh and he could have been lying. Racial terrorists tend to be treated harsher in court and prison than a random shooter. Literally if they just thought for longer than a minute they'd figure this out. It fits their narrative that people pay too much attention to race. That's the only reason why they are criticising people who say it definitely was racially motivated so much. They want their audience to think ""oh so people claim racism when there isn't any"" when it comes to other problems too. Then they talk about the model minority myth. They mention how Asians on average are performing better than black people on average despite also having had systematic racism. They claim Asians are doing better because of cultural values and then dismiss the idea that slavery is still affecting black people The systemic racism that black people had to deal with was and is completely different than Asians. And yes, centuries of slavery is actually a good example. They must think that all discrimination is the same, no matter the type or duration. Third video: So kids show is basically saying ""families with two dads, two mums, or two non-binary people and any sexuality can be happy"" and that's a bad thing? The show seems kinda boring to me but like I'm not gonna make a video and complain about it being bad lmao Also, asexual people are accepted in the lgbt community because many asexual people think that there must something wrong with them or their lack of sexual desires may affect their mental health by affecting relationships or whatever, so ofc the lgbt community should be accepting. The lgbt community is about being happy with your sexuality, and asexuality counts. ""agenda"" lol I love it when they use that word cause the agenda is just accepting people for who they are. If I had a nickle for everytime they use that retoric, I'd be a billionnare by now. Okay now he's saying that pride is forcing labels onto children and making them ""pick a box"". No.... It's about letting everyone know that if you are gay/lesbian/trans/whatever that it's okay and you should feel happy. If some gay child thinks that something is wrong with them, they might be helped by their cartoons saying ""it's okay to be gay"" People like him think that if we wouldn't mention lgbt stuff at all then no one would feel bad. But our society is heteronormative (the norm is to be straight) so children might be confused if they don't feel heterosexual and we know as a fact that children who are lgbt face more difficulty accepting themselves. And LMAO, he just said that it's a undeniable fact that the ""cultural forces"" want kids to be gay. That's just so ridiculous. Pride is about accepting people who are lgbt *because* many people want them to just be straight. He says young people don't have a sexual identity yet, well what if someone gets bullied at school because they have two dads? Or because they like to dress differently or whatever. Why does this guy have such a problem with messaging that is literally just ""be proud if you're lgbt or have lgbt people in your family"" I'd love it if this guy pointed out where and when the videos said or even implied that you shouldn't be straight. Notice how these people never talk about anti-lgbt violence or discrimination? It's because they want their audience to think that all this pride stuff is for nothing Also why would there be such a massive effort to turn kids gay? Like who is doing this and why? There is no monetary or strategic advantage gained from that. His conspiracy theory doesn't make any sense because even the simple question of ""what would anyone have to gain from that"" can't be answered. Anywho, those are my thoughts on the matter, feel free to watch this dumpster fire yourself and share your own thoughts below.",1,['Videos in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4Y1m28hVtk&t=503s']
