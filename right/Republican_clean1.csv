However, if we imposed caps on procedure costs and cut private lobbying against standard pricing (and this would have to be one of the more carful parts, as to not dig into hospital profits more than they can sustain) then it would lower the “number to reach” by a very large margin. So if we combined a modest tax hike with a federally regulated cap on medical procedures and drugs then we get the budget.\nAlso we spend a lot of money on Medicaid, but imagine if unhealthy people were free from monetary responsibilities and could seek treatment.

To say for certain they would go up in the US is untrue. The higher education expenses is not the same. The government is actually making money off school loans. If the government nationalized higher education the costs would plummet. The subsidized loans allowed colleges to skirt capitalism. If the government said we’ll give unforgivable loans to anyone with a medical bill, yes, that would cause prices to skyrocket. That’s not even remotely the same as what’s being discussed. While I agree the government is shit at managing things the usps is the worst example.

Ever notice how real quiet things got over there once biden won? Things got quiet here too when trump was in office. The moment “your” president isn’t in office the country is suddenly on fire over night. Problems like this obviously go far and wide but the ignorance people subject themselves to is pretty wild.
