So if everyone were able to be vaxxed from the start, a death toll of 8,900. Alright. That's what, like a couple days' worth of opioid ODs? Versus literally the population of Indianapolis. "", 'I never once implied that the vaccine was ineffective prior to Omnicron that‚Äôs why I was not afraid to say as much. Yes, of course the CEO of Pfizer stands to gain, but let‚Äôs not play things up, he said 3 shots were satisfactory not the miracle Biden claimed at CNN town hall, where no one vaccinated would die. Let‚Äôs also not pretend everything I‚Äôve argued so far crumbles because one aspect of it is questionable. Hospitalizations are important, but I say again, under Omnicron they‚Äôve been observed to be substantially shorter on average and less severe when compared to prior variants. Hospitalizations are important, your chances of dying are more so, but both are drastically better under Omnicron.', 'Biden\'s a sycophant that would say anything to get elected. I\'m of the mind that anyone who would actively seek that degree of power and maintain their sanity must by necessity be able to suspend or entirely lack their sense of empathy, just to bear the weight of power. The bar for entry into the presidency is sociopathy in all but perhaps a very few number of cases, again, in my own opinion. Misinformation comes from all sides, really all you can do is learn to recognize it and sort it from the genuine article. I know we all think we know what it looks like, particularly in politically focused subs, but I would just ask that you consider the opposing perspective without prejudice and try to understand that we shouldn\'t be fighting each other but the motherfuckers that said ""Let\'s you and him fight"".', 'I think we can agree on a good amount. I‚Äôm not very fond of many in power, including those I align with best. I also am hardly against vaccines, I myself and vaccinated, purely because I don‚Äôt like dealing with the hassle that comes with not being vaccinated. I also, even now wouldn‚Äôt disagree that you‚Äôd fair better vaccinated, but I think that the extent to which you‚Äôd do better has been made minuscule with Omnicron compared to prior variants. Ultimately I think people should mask or vaccinate if that‚Äôs what they choose.', 'You really think that the power hungry Democrats would let life go back to normal even if we got 100% vaccinated? They don‚Äôt even believe triple vaxxed people should be without a mask or do anything normal human beings do. Vaccines don‚Äôt stop you from spreading and catching COVID.', ""To what end would it serve to keep restrictions in place if hospitalizations fall back to manageable levels? That's the entire point of the restrictions and proposed vax mandates.  Keep more people out of the hospital and away from the enormous hair clog COVID has lodged in our metaphorical shower drain of an already weak medical system. Increase vaccinations, reduce hospitalizations, and restrictions are loosened."", 'COVID is not going anywhere, no matter how much you try to hide from it. No amount of vaccinations, mask wearing, lockdowns, etc. are going to keep you from catching it. I know it scares some people, but that‚Äôs just reality. Let everyone go back to normal life. And if you‚Äôre still too scared, no one is stopping you from staying at home.', ""I'm not really concerned about myself. I'm triple-vaxxed, smoke free, early 30s. My chances of getting and dying of it are insanely low, to the point of statistically impossible. No, how about keeping the orderlies from killing my grandma? How about letting my grandma out of the home once in a while? Her memory is already going, she asked me tonight how school was going. I've not been in school since 2013.

Oil plunged and rigs were shut down. Oil prices hit -$37/ barrel. Yes negative. There has been no major rush by the oil producers to get them back on line although the weekly Baker Hughes Rig Count has been slowly rising. Big oil profit margins are soaring. Just look at Halliburton stock. We should be using all methods to produce all kinds of energy production, not just pumping oil. Wind, solar, all renewables, etc...instead, seems like the big oil and Manchin has us cornered again, just like 1973.', 'So I live in the second largest oil producing state in the union and we just signed the biggest building project in state history. We‚Äôre going to capture the natural gas that is usually flailed off in the drilling process. 6 billion dollar project all funded through private investment. We have oil, gas, wind, some coal, solar, hydro, everything except nuclear so we‚Äôre pretty diversified. Canceling of federal drilling permits really hurt the smaller operators and the larger companies swooped in and bought up their remaining permits putting them out of business.', 'The drilling permit temporary moratorium on federal land was for new drilling only. There are currently 3 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the US. Most are not plugged. Biden administration plans to shell out $1.15 billion to clean them up. I say that cost should be included in any newly applied drilling permit. And cut out subsidizing big oil. Too many lobbyist I know. Wish we could find a young president that would make companies and people accountable. We need a Teddy Roosevelt real bad.', 'That‚Äôs true but it sent the oil futures price skyrocketing. If you‚Äôre a smaller operation and you know that you can only compete for federal drilling permits because the larger companies have outbid you on private land you‚Äôre forced to close. If you‚Äôre a company that sells drilling equipment and you lose those smaller companies, there‚Äôs no way to compete with Halliburton. Biden‚Äôs energy  policies put more money in their pockets than anyone ever did and they return the favor with campaign contributions. By closing those drilling permits he in effect made drilling out here a monopoly and as every day passes they gain an even larger share.', ""Has no bearing on current prices. Oil prices are global. Maybe taking out of the SOR, (strategic oil reserve) would help temporarily but there is a risk if Russia invades. Drilling from date of permit to drill takes many years before production. My son is a Geologist and they would need at least 18 months just to do their work. Oil wells are not made to stop and start. There literally was no place to put the pumped oil by April of 2020. They shut them down. There is no incentive to get them up and running until the price goes up.. the fear is that the Oil producers will overproduction again and the wells will need to be shut off again. Plus trying to hiring is a nightmare. Russia and OPEC have way more control over prices than us. Trump did a good job putting pressure on them, but with the threat of war, prices are not going anywhere but up.. Still way cheaper than when I was a kid in high-school in the mid 1970s. Cars got 16 mpg, price was $1.25 per gallon by 1977 and minimum wage was $2.35. That's 2 gallons per hour of work or 32 miles. We did have a major recession though. Sift through the social media crap that is out there."", 'Except when you take out smaller companies that supplied upwards of 20% of production and saw no future in continuing to drill it most definitely affects price. Oil may be global but areas of high productivity still pay less than other places. When I was in Saudi Arabia we gassed up the Landcruisers at 5 cents a gallon, this was during a time when gas was over $4 in the US. Taxes play a role but not that dramatically. I grew up in the early 80‚Äôs, think my Charger got 8mpg and could pass anything except a gas station. Think I made $3.35/hr, my kids grew up never knowing what it was like to see a paycheck go into a gas tank.', ""I agree. Good story. Saudi subsidizes fuel to keep the citizens happy.

541,Confessions of a tax preparer - 2022 edition.,325,text,"I‚Äôve been preparing taxes for several years, through 3 presidents now. In case you don‚Äôt know, the tax laws change each year, and from administration to administration.  In my experience, the most incredible tax returns were during the Trump era. Families filing jointly, single head of household parents, even single individuals were getting some of the biggest returns I‚Äôve ever seen. In addition to a booming economy and lower gas prices, we had it good for 2016-2020. We are now one month into the 2022 season.  In addition to higher gas prices, higher food prices, and the lost value of the dollar due to Biden inflation, tax returns are SIGNIFICANTLY lower this year. People who were getting $7k last year, with the exact same job and deductions are getting less than HALF this year.  The advance child tax credit is also screwing people‚Äôs returns as a lot of folks were duped into believing that the ACTC was a part of covid relief. ITS NOT! The ACTC was just an advance of this years child tax credit. So if you got a $3k total ACTC, this years CTC is reduced by $3k resulting in a smaller return.  This makes it even more difficult for my company to charge accordingly, ultimately bringing in less revenue for the business. So if you ever wonder and say that it takes years to see the effects of a presidential administration, think again. This administration is affecting US ALL, RIGHT NOW, IN OUR BANK ACCOUNTS! Why someone would EVER vote for a Democrat is far beyond any sensible comprehension.
